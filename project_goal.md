# Project Goal

To build a simple network simulator game capable of the following:

- Creating computers that can be used. (they run a very simple command line OS)
- Ability to create desktop towers (at the building desk) or to setup servers (in the server room)
- Computers should have adjustable hard drives, memory and CPUs.
- Simulating a simple network.
- Connecting these simple computers to the network.
- Remotely accessing computers on the network.
- Visually managing cables connected to network switches.
- Ability to create new cables to plugin network switches.
- Ability to connect computers to a patch panel.
- Ability to visually connect patch panel to network switches.
- An inventory system to store computer parts that are not deployed.
- An interface for upgrading or building computers.

## Scenes

The game will have the following scenes.

1. Your desk. This is where your computer is that you use to remote into other computers and run commands.
2. The server room. This is where you manage the cables connecting your switches to your patch panels.
3. Computer building desk. This is where you order new machines and configure them before setting them out for your network.

## Scope

For now the project scope is a single office with up to 150 employees. When the game starts the employee count is smaller so the network can be stood up quickly. As the game progresses, more employees are hired and the network must grow to meet the demand.
