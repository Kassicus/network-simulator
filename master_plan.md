# Network Simulator Game: Action Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Set up a Python project structure (src, tests, assets, docs, etc.).
   - Initialize version control (Git) and create a .gitignore.
   - Set up a virtual environment and requirements.txt (include pygame).
   - Create a README with project overview and setup instructions.

2. **Core Architecture Design**
   - Define main game loop and scene management structure.
   - Design a modular system for adding/removing scenes (desk, server room, building desk).
   - Plan for logging and error handling (structured logs, context, timestamps).

## Phase 2: Core Game Systems

3. **Computer & Inventory System**
   - Design data models for computers (attributes: hard drive, memory, CPU).
   - Implement inventory system for computer parts (CRUD operations).
   - UI for building/configuring computers at the building desk.

4. **Network Simulation**
   - Model a simple network: computers, switches, patch panels, cables.
   - Implement logic for connecting/disconnecting devices and cables.
   - Visual representation of network topology and cable management.

5. **Remote Access & Command Line OS**
   - Create a simple in-game command line interface for computers.
   - Implement remote access functionality from player's desk.
   - Simulate basic OS commands (list files, check status, etc.).

## Phase 3: Scene Implementation

6. **Scene 1: Player Desk**
   - UI for player's computer and remote access panel.
   - Logging/audit for remote access actions.

7. **Scene 2: Server Room**
   - Visual management of cables, switches, patch panels.
   - Drag-and-drop or click-to-connect interface for cables.

8. **Scene 3: Computer Building Desk**
   - Interface for ordering, assembling, and configuring new computers.
   - Inventory management and part upgrades.

## Phase 4: Game Progression & Scaling

9. **Employee & Network Growth**
   - Implement employee count and progression logic.
   - Scale network complexity as more employees are hired.
   - UI feedback for network load and performance.

10. **Upgrade & Maintenance Mechanics**
    - Allow upgrades to computers and network infrastructure.
    - Simulate failures, maintenance, and repairs.

---

## Phase 5: Polish, Testing, and Documentation

11. **Testing**
    - Unit and integration tests for core systems.
    - Edge case and failure condition coverage.

12. **Polish & UX Improvements**
    - Refine UI/UX for all scenes.
    - Add sound, animations, and visual feedback.

13. **Documentation**
    - Update README and add user/developer guides.
    - Document code, architecture, and business rules.

14. **Logging & Audit**
    - Ensure all critical operations are logged with context and timestamps.
    - Implement audit logs for user actions (especially remote access, upgrades, etc.).

---

## Phase 6: Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Multiplayer or networked play.
- More complex OS simulation.
- Advanced network topologies.
- Security incidents and troubleshooting scenarios.

### Next Steps

- Review and refine this plan as needed.
- Prioritize Phase 1 tasks and begin project setup.
